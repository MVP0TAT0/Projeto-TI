The Interface Technologies project (course year 2024/2025) has been divided into five main milestones, each one with a deadline. It is mandatory to be developed by groups of three students (attending the same PL class). Students shall create a physical tailor-made user interface or artifact for humans, relying on their knowledge about interaction technologies. The developed product should comprise two parts: (i) a physical interface component, using an Arduino; (ii) an application component, written in any suitable programming language for your project requirements. The application component should work in cooperation with the physical computing components, exchanging sensor(s) and actuator(s) information with the Arduino (via serial communication, or other means).

**Minimum requirements for the project:**
• At least 2 types of sensory physical inputs (e.g. movement, light, temperature, sound, etc.)
• At least 1 type of physical output or actuator
• Integration of, at least, one capability related to sound or image processing in the application component


**Milestone 2 — Conceptualisation and Prototyping (21 April)**
Conceptualisation and early prototyping of the product. This milestone comprises two deliverables:
> 1. A report (c. 5000 words) describing the concept, the steps of the interaction design methodology involved, and the implementation strategy (including a simple description of the plan and analysis/identification of critical issues that might obstruct the development). We expect you to provide as much prototyping detail as possible (e.g. 3D sketches, 2D projections, sketches, or high-fidelity prototypes of any object that you intend to build).

 
> 2. A partial prototype implementation 25-50% of the final product. Grading for this milestone will take into account the development stage. The Arduino part of the implementation should include a schematic for the circuit and the corresponding code
